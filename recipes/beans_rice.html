                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>This is a classic homemade recipe I came up with for
                        perfect black beans and rice. The whole dish can be
                        made in under 20 minutes using my techniques for
                        cooking rice quickly.
                    </p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup of rice (any kind, but I prefer a blend of jasmine 
                            and long grain white)</li>
                        <li>1 can of black beans</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                        <li>Black pepper</li>
                        <li>Cumin (optional)</li>
                        <li>Cayenne (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>  </p>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place the rice into a pot and rinse it several times
                            to remove excess starch, drain
                        </li>
                        <li>Add the water to the po (covered) and place on high heat until 
                            it starts to boil
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove lid and stir rice briefly, put lid back on and boil
                            on low heat for an additional 18 minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>While the rice is boiling, remove beans from can and microwave
                            for one minute in a bowl
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove bowl from the microwave and mix in all spices, stir
                            thouroughly, microwave for an additional 2 minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove rice from heat and let stand partially uncovered for
                            3-5 minutes
