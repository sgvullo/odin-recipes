                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Take a trip with me to Poland! Or rather, a trip to
                        the frozen pierogi section at your local grocer.
                        These pierogi will taste just like grandmas, and are paired
                        with a lovely side of scrambled eggs.
    
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Half a box of Mrs. T's Frozen Pierogi's (any flavor) </li>

                            <li>Olive oil</li>

                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Place the pierogi on a plate and microwave them for
                                2 minutes on high
                            </li>
                            <li>Oil the pan and let it start to heat up on medium heat</li>
                            <li>When the pan is sufficiently heated, place pierogi in pan
                                and fry on both sides for 4 minutes each, flipping every minute 
                            </li>
                            <li>When the pierogi are golden brown, remove from pan and let sit on
                                a plate while preparing the eggs
                            </li>
                            <li>Using the leftover oil from the pan, add the eggs and lightly scramble
                                for 1 minute
                            </li>
                            <li>Remove eggs and place onto the plate with the pierogi. Lightly season with
                                Salt and Pepper. Enjoy!
